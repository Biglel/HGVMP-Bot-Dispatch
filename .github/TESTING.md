# Testing

You need to run tests after every code change, so that you're sure your that
your code is consistent with AirBnB's [style guide] and doesn't break anything.

## Step 1: Automated Tests

After you've coded your heart out, run all the specified test scripts, by
running this in your terminal:

```bash
npm test
```

## Step 2: Manual Tests

After you've done the automated tests, and fixed any issues found, you need to
test for yourself that your changes to the code are working fine.
